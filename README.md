I run the Solutions Architecture practice for Epsilon's Digital Arm, and excited to get back to Traveling. Visit [https://eric-pierce.com/](https://eric-pierce.com/) for project summaries.

Here's what I'm working on now:
- I just finished up my Master's of Data Science at Northwestern, which I've been doing on nights/weekends for the past three years
- I'm working through LeetCode questions
